# CS373_2023_Assignment_Barcode_Detection

This repository provides a Python 3 code skeleton for the image processing assignment of CompSci 373 in Semester 1, 2023.  This assignment will require you to use what we have studied in the image processing lectures to generate a software that detects barcodes in images of household items.  You will receive 10 marks for solving the barcode detection problem, and there will be an additional component for 5 marks, where you will extend upon the barcode detection in a separate file, and write a short reflective report about your extension.
